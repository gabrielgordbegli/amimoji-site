        On January 18th 1965 the almighty Mojtaba “Big Wave” Kashef was released into the wild. The internet says
        Mojtaba means “the chosen one”, however, most Kashefs call him “big wave”. I’m not sure which one is the actual
        translation, but “big wave” certainly speaks volumes to his personality. He is a powerful wave that has offered
        guidance to all, even in through the stormiest of seas.
