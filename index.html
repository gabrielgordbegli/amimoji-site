        On January 18th 1965 the almighty Mojtaba Kashef was released into the wild and quite frankly the wild has never been the same. The internet agrees Mojtaba means “the chosen one”, however, every Kashef I know calls him “big wave”. Regardless of which is the actual meaning, “big wave” speaks volumes to his personality. He is a powerful wave which offers guidance to all, solicited or not, through the stormiest of seas.
